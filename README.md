# WildMagic
A stylish way to roll a wild magic surge from D&amp;D 5e, check it out here: https://haa-gg.github.io/WildMagic/

Based on the wild magic surge table which you can check out here: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer:wild-magic

## Technical Junk
This project is mostly a way too exercise my design muscles, the majority of time was spend making the background into multiple assets that will look good on anything from a cell phone to a jumbotron at a football field

Background is made of a hi-res grunge texture, an SVG of a D20 (20-sided dice for the less nerdy) and some CSS for the outer glow on the background dice SVG

The tech to make the dice actually select a random value from a JSON table is based on my repo, The Improbability Drive which you can check out here: https://github.com/haa-gg/Improbability-Drive
